# Image-classification-using-CNN
Why is CNN good for image classification? The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or ConvNet) is a subtype of the Neural Networks that is mainly used for applications in image and speech recognition. Its built-in convolutional layer reduces the high dimensionality of images without losing its information.
